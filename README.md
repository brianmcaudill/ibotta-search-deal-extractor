# ibotta-search-deal-extractor
For now the ibotta data can be extracted kinda by hand from the ibotta.com site
1) login
2) go to the page that you want the data from, lets say CVS Offers
3) Open the developer console in the browser by clicking F12
4) copy and paste this code that is inside code.js into the developer console

Maybe one day my lazy ass will make a browser extension or use selenium or something better:)
