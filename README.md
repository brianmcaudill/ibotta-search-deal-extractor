# ibotta-search-deal-extractor
For now the ibotta data can be extracted kinda by hand from the ibotta.com site
1) login
2) go to the page that you want the data from, lets say CVS Offers
3) Open the developer console in the browser by pr3essing F12 on the keyboared
4) copy and paste this code that is inside code.js into the developer code console (if you dont know what that is google it)

Maybe one day my lazy ass will make a browser extension or use selenium or something better:)
